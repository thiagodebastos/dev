      Superannuation policy is a complex subject that people often find difficult to understand. Here’s a guide to give you an
      idea of how these changes could affect you, and whether you’ll be better or worse off if they go ahead.

        <p>Australia’s superannuation system is <a href="#">consistently regarded</a> as one of the best in the world. At the
          moment, the law says employers must pick a default super account for new workers who don’t pick one themselves.
          The Fair Work Commission applies a quality filter to shortlist super funds for employers to choose from, most of
          which are not-for-profit industry funds that often outperform the their retail and bank-owned competitors.</p>

        <p>Industry super funds are typically run by a mixture of representatives from employer groups and unions, which don’t
          earn a profit and act in the interests of their members, unlike bank-owned funds, which also generate corporate
          profits which are returned as dividends to shareholders, not superfund members. Super contributions are also classed
          as compulsory workplace entitlements, which ensures that all working Australians can access super as a right, not
          as a luxury.
        </p>

        <p>The major banks are lobbying the government to make changes to superannuation laws so that banks can get access to
          more workers super. The government is preparing to act on the banks wish list including changing the boards of
          industry super funds so they are run more like bank-owned funds, and are looking to remove the default protections
          that ensure workers who don’t choose a super fund are put in a high-performing fund.

        <p>So are these changes necessary? The numbers consistently show not-for-profit industry super funds on average, provide
          greater returns for members and are more trusted by the public than for-profit funds run by major banks. People
          are especially supportive of super funds being run in the interests of their members rather than for a profit motive,
          and are concerned about any efforts to reduce superannuation from a workplace entitlement to just another part
          of the finance sector.</p>
